# Docker-specific environment configuration
# This file should be used when running services inside Docker containers
#
# Key difference from .env: DATABASE_URL uses 'db' instead of 'localhost'
# because services communicate via Docker service names, not localhost

# Database Configuration for Docker
# Use the 'db' service name defined in docker-compose.yml
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@db:5432/talk_to_folder

# API Keys and credentials
# These are typically sourced from the root .env file
# For local Docker development, you can set them here or let docker-compose
# inherit them from the root .env via env_file directive

# Example if you want all credentials in one place:
# GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-value
# GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-value
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-value
# FIREWORKS_API_KEY=your-value
# MISTRAL_API_KEY=your-value
# SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key

# For development, it's common to NOT duplicate credentials here
# Instead, use in docker-compose.yml:
#   env_file:
#     - .env.docker  # For database URL
#     - .env         # For API keys and other values
